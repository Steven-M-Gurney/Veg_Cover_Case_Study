# PURPOSE
# -------
# This script reads the prepared MiFI working dataset created in Phase 1,
# Part 1 and conducts exploratory data analysis and quality assurance checks.
# Simply put, its purpose is to better understand the prepared MiFI working 
# dataset before formal analysis.
#
# This script is designed to:
#
#   1) Confirm that the prepared working dataset loaded correctly.
#   2) Summarize missing and placeholder values.
#   3) Check authority, management area, cover type, canopy closure, management
#      status, duplicate stand records, and acreage distributions.
#   4) Create simple QA figures that help understand data limitations.
#
#
# INPUTS
# ------
#   • Prepared, full working dataset:
#       stands_working_prepped.rds

#
# OUTPUTS

# IMPORTANT INTERPRETATION NOTES
# ------------------------------
# This script is exploratory and diagnostic. Outputs document dataset structure, 
# completeness, temporal characteristics, and potential limitations that inform 
# downstream analyses. It does not estimate ecological change or produce final 
# analytical summaries. Its purpose is to better understand the prepared MiFI
# working dataset before formal analysis.
#
#
# 📋 Summary of EDA/QC Findings
# -----------------------------
#
# The summary below reflects the prepared Wildlife Division dataset generated
# from the MiFI snapshot used in this analysis.
#
# 1. The prepared working dataset contained 19,949 stand records representing
#    19,588 unique stands, approximately 406,252 mapped acres, 266
#    compartments, and 104 management areas. 
#
# 2. Core vegetation attributes were generally complete. Missing Level-3 and
#    Level-4 cover-type information occurred in approximately 2% of records,
#    while canopy closure information was missing in approximately 1% of
#    records. These records were retained in the working dataset and may be 
#    later addressed through analysis-specific filtering.
#
# 3. Management-status attributes contained substantial uncertainty. More than
#    half of records were coded as either "Unspecified" or missing, which may
#    reflect inventory methodology. Management-status summaries should be 
#    interpreted cautiously and may require additional information for more 
#    meaningful interpretation. 
#
# 4. Stand acreage distributions were strongly right-skewed. Median stand size
#    was approximately 9 acres, whereas mean stand size exceeded 20 acres.
#    A relatively small number of very large polygons exerted substantial
#    influence on acreage-based summaries.
#
# 5. Water and wetland cover types dominated the upper tail of the acreage
#    distribution. Eight of the ten largest polygons were classified as Water,
#    while the remaining two were classified as Emergent Wetland (Phragmites).
#    Consequently, acreage-based summaries may be disproportionately influenced
#    by a relatively small number of large aquatic or wetland features.
#
# 6. Water represented a disproportionately large share of mapped acreage.
#    Although Water accounted for only approximately 3% of stand records, it
#    represented approximately 11% of total mapped acreage. Individual
#    management areas contained up to 10,000 acres of mapped water, and water
#    accounted for as much as 66% of total acreage within some management areas. 
#    It may be valuable for water cover to be considered separately when 
#    interpreting terrestrial vegetation summaries.
#
# 7. Forested cover types dominated the inventory, with Lowland Deciduous
#    Forest, Mixed Upland Deciduous Forest, Oak Types, and Aspen representing
#    major components of both stand counts and mapped acreage.
#
# 8. Canopy-closure distributions reflected the broad diversity of cover types
#    represented in the inventory. Open, intermediate, and closed-canopy
#    conditions were all well represented. Sub-canopy cover was not carried
#    forward for analysis because approximately 99% of forested stand records
#    were missing sub-canopy information or contained zero values interpreted as
#    no data. However, it is likely that sub-canopy data may exist somewhere in a
#    different dataset.
#
# 9. Duplicate stand identifiers (fcskey values) were uncommon and may reflect
#    repeated inventory, stand updates, or database maintenance rather than 
#    data-entry errors. These repeated records provide the foundation for
#    developing rolling inventory snapshots.
#
# 10. Temporal evaluation identified legacy and placeholder dates within the
#     database. Records dated 1899 and 1900 were present in inventory and
#     creation-date fields and were interpreted as migration artifacts,
#     placeholder values, or legacy database behavior rather than true
#     inventory dates.
#
# 11. The created_date and last_edited_date fields appeared to reflect database
#     migration and administrative activity rather than ecological inventory
#     timing. In contrast, the date field most closely represented stand-level
#     inventory or assessment activity and was therefore selected for temporal
#     analyses.
#
# 12. Inventory records were concentrated between approximately 2010 and 2025,
#     further supporting that MiFI functions as a rolling inventory rather than 
#     a synchronized statewide inventory.
#
# 13. Based on the most recent inventory record associated with each unique
#     stand, stand data were an average of approximately 9 years old
#     (median = 9.5 years; IQR = 5–13 years). Approximately 16% of stands
#     had not been inventoried within the previous 15 years.
#
# 14. Because inventory dates span multiple decades and inventory effort has
#     varied through time, direct comparison of mapped cover-type acreage among
#     years would confound ecological change with changes in inventory
#     coverage, stand updates, and database growth. These findings informed 
#     development of the rolling-snapshot approach used for temporal analyses.
